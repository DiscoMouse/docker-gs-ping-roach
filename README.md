# docker-gs-ping-roach

A sample Go web application example for [Docker's Go language-specific guide](https://docs.docker.com/language/golang/).

This application builds on the basic example introduced in [docker/docker-gs-ping](https://github.com/docker/docker-gs-ping) and uses [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach) database engine.
